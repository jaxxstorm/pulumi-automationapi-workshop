# Pulumi Automation API Workshop

This workshop will guide you through the process of building an small web application that allows you to deploy to Kubernetes using Pulumi's Automation API.

It takes inspiration and code from Komal Ali's [static site platyform](https://github.com/komalali/static-site-platyform) but uses Kubernetes as the end mechanism.

## Prerequsities

Before you start with this workshop, you'll need to have the Pulumi CLI installed and be logged into the Pulumi SaaS backend to store your state.

You'll also need a Kubernetes cluster provisioned and running. You can check you have everything you need using `kubectl`
